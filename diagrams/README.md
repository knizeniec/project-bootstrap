# diagrams

Purpose: Architecture and workflow diagrams supporting decision records.

This directory is a slot. The [`prompts/language-adaptation.md`](../prompts/language-adaptation.md) adoption prompt may populate or remove it depending on whether the project will maintain diagram sources alongside the code.

Template default:

- Keep diagrams aligned with ADR decisions in `docs/adr/`.
- Prefer source files that can be regenerated or edited, not only exported images.
- Remove this folder if your chosen stack does not need it.
